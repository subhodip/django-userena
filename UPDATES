This file contains all the backwards-incompatible changes.

Version 1.2.0

- This version updates Userena to be able to use the new `User` model found in
  Django 1.5. This does require the django-guardion > 1.5-dev. To make this
  work, there is a `get_user_model` function in `userena/utils.py` which is used
  to get the correct `User` model.

Version 1.1.2

- Activation view no longer contains username. If you override
  `userena/templates/userena/emails/activation_email_message.txt` and
  `userena/templates/userena/emails/confirmation_email_message_new.txt` be sure
  to remove username from the URL.

Version 1.1

- Userena now requires Django >= 1.3 because of the use of class based views.

Version 1.0.1

- Removed the ``user`` relationship outside ``UserenaBaseProfile`` model. This
  allows the user to define it's own relationship and fixes a conflict while
  running ``manage.py test``. To migrate, place the ``user`` field inside your
  profile model, instead of inheriting it from the ``abstract`` class.
